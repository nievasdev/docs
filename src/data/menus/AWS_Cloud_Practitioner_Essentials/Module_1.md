<code>Transcript: Introduction to AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials</code>

**Rudy**: Hey everyone! Welcome to the course. We hope you're ready to drive in and learn the fundamentals of the AWS cloud.

**Alan**: We have a lot of material to cover. And we're going to start with defining; what is the cloud?

**Morgan**: But, before we do that, let's start with some introductions. Hi, I'm Morgan Willis, a Principal Cloud Technologist with AWS Training and Certification. I started in the IT world about 15 years ago. And along the way, I decided that I was missing something.

I missed the helping and teaching aspect that I had in my first job in IT support. So, I went into teaching at a software development bootcamp. And then I eventually landed here at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, where, as a Cloud Technologist, I get to support others in their cloud learning journey every day.

**Rudy**: Howzit learners! My name is Rudy Chetty and I'm a Chief Techfluencer and a Principle Solutions Architect for AWS Partners. I'm originally from sunny Cap Town, South Africa... the home of bunny chow, biltong and boerewors. I've been in the technology space for over two decades helping customers worldwide realize their application and cloud dreams. Education is my passion. Therefore, I cannot wait for you to dive into this course and learn all about the wonders of the cloud and AWS.

**Alan**: And I'm Alan Meridian. I'm an istructor in AWS TRaining and Certification. Over the last eight plus years with AWS, I've delivered hundreds of trainings introducing learners like you to AWS concepts, services, and solutions-sometimes involving ukuleles. I'm glad you're here. We're going to learn a lot together.

**Rudy**: Look, cloud computing can be complex. But don't worry. This is why we're here! Our curriculum provides analogies, examples, and use cases that will help you better understand the concepts. We'll cover all the essential information you need to be comfortable discussing AWS. Additionally, we'll throw in some AWS service demos to show you how things work in action. This layered approach to learning wiill really reinforce concepts. oh, and we promise to keep it simple.

**Morgan**: AWS offers a massive range of services for every business. AWS is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, and millions of customers use AWS to be more agile, lower costs, and innovate faster. Whether you're looking for compute power, generative AI, databases, storage, content delivery, or specialized services for some other functionality, AWS has the services you need to help you build sophisticated applications for your business.

**Alan**: Let's have Morgan be the server, the barista. And I'll be the client, or the customer. I'm gonna make a request. In this case, it's for coffee. In the computing world, the request could be for anything. It could be rain pattern analysis in South Africa, or it could be the latest x-rays of your knee, or videos of kittens. Whatever the business need is where the request starts. Basically, a customer makes a request, and with permissions, the server responds to that request. All I want is a caffeinated bevarage. Morgan represents the server part of the client-server model. In AWS, she would be a virtual server. So, from a cloud computing architectural point of view, the coffe shop transaction is pretty straightforward. I, the user, made a request to Morgan, the server. Morgan validated that the request was legitimate. In this case, did I give her money? Is the item that I ordered something that they can make? Then she returned a response, which in this example, is a tripple mocha with extra caramel shots.

**Morgan**: Now, in the real world, applications are usually more complicated than just a single transaction with a single server. In a business solution that is more mature, it can gen beautifully complex. But again, we're going to start with the basics. As the curriculum progresses, the basic concepts will continue to build on each other. And hopefully, by the end, those beautifully complex concepts will make a lot more sense. You've already tackled your first cloud computing concept. So now, let's continue with a key concept of AWS, and that is, you only pay for what you use.

**Rudy**: Think about this principle as it applies to staffing a coffe shop. Employees are only paid for the hours they work in the actual shop. So, if say Morgan and I are off the clock, well, then we don't get paid because we didn't work any hours. Moreover, the store owner decides how many baristas they need for any given day of the week. Busy days require more employees and slower days require fewer. Let's take an example. Say the coffe shop is releasing a brand-new drink called Rudy's Rhubarb Refresher. Trademark. The shop anticipates increased demand due to the bevarage being very tasty, so they staff the shop with 10 baristas all day long. Although this works with a sudden surge of customers, it isn't great for slower periods during the day. Some baristas could be idle, and it would be hard to justify paying them to just be there in case they are needed. The monetary cost just doesn't make good financial sense.

**Alan**: And yet, this is exactly what happens in an on-premises data center where you can't just snap your fingers and triple your capacity. At AWS, you don't ppre-pay for anything. And you don't have to worry about capacity constraints.

**Rudy**: When you need more resources, you just provision them right then and there. How cool is that? Then, when you don't need those resources anymore, you can deprovision just as quickly. You just set up the right configuration and it's done automatically. And the best part is that when you deprovision the resources, you stop paying for them immediately. Just like you only pay your employees for the hours they're working, you only pay for the AWS resources that you consume.

**Morgan**: Right. So, paying only for what you use is the first AWS specific concept we covered--and it's just one of the many benefits when it comes to running your business on AWS. And that's really why we're here: so you can understand how AWS is built to help you run your business better.

**Alan**: Exactly. You've already learned some foundational concepts about the cloud...and that's just the start!

**Rudy**: Yep, things are only going to get more interesting, folks, as we dive deeper! Thanks for joining us on this learning journey, future AWS Cloud Pratitioner. See you soon.

# The AWS Cloud Practitioner Coffee Shop

In this training, we use a coffe shop analogy to help you better understand basic cloud concepts. To explore the coffe shop and learn more about your instructors, choose each of the following four numbered markers.

1. In the video, we used the example of a customer ordering a cup of coffee to help explain how a client-server model works.

As this training progresses, you will continue to see comparisons between elements of a coffee shop and cloud computing functions. For example, you will explore how different AWS compute instances are kind of like the different types of coffe machines in a coffee shop. Each machine is workload-specific to better serve its customers.

The purpose of the coffe shop analogy is to reduce complexity of cloud concepts and take your cloud knowledge from theoretical concept to practical experience.

# 3 What is Cloud Computing ?

## Transcript: What is Cloud Computing?

Before we dive into cloud computing, let's rewind the clock and set some context for how Amazon grew to include Amazon Web Services. In the early 2000s, Amazon.com was an ecommerce site that customers used to buy books and other consumer goods. As more people started to use the site, the Amazon IT team had to continually make upgrades to keep things running smoothly. More servers, more storage, more compute. You name it. They were deploying it!

The team evantually decided to develop various standardized tools mechanisms, and ways to make things more efficient and scalable. These methods proved to be quite effective, and in 2003, employees thought, "Maybe this knowledge would be valuable to other companies facing similar challenges." Thus, Amazon started to envision a service that would allow businesses to rent computing power, storage, and other resources, on-demand. This business model could eliminate the need for upfront investment in hardware.

Just a year later, in November 2004, AWS launched its first public infrastructure service: Amazon Simple Queue Service. Two years later, AWS launched Amazon Simple Storage Service for
