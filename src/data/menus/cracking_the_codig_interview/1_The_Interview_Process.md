title: The Interview Process
---

At most of the top tech companies (and many other companies), **algorithm and coding problems** form the largest component of the interview process. Think of these as *problem-solving questions*. <mark>The interviewer is looking to evaluate your ability to solve algorithmic problems you haven't seen before.</mark>

Very often, you might get through only one question in an interview. **Forty-five minutes** is not a long time, and it's difficult to get through several different questions in that time frame.

You should do your best to **talk out loud** throughout the problem and explain your thought process. Your interviewer might jump in sometimes to help you; let them. It's normal and doesn't really mean that you're doing poorly. (That said, of course not needing hints is even better.)

At the end of the interview, the interviewer will walk away with a *gut feel* for how you did. A numerical score might be assigned to your performance, but it's not actually a quantitative assessment. <mark>There's no chart that says how many points you get for different things. It just doesn't work like that.</mark>

Rather, your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:

- **Analytical skills**: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?

- **Coding skills**: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think about potential errors? Did you use good style?

- **Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals**: Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?

- **Experience**: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?

- **Culture fit / Communication skills**: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

The weighting of these areas will vary based on the question, interviewer, role, team, and company. In a standard algorithm question, it might be almost entirely the first three of those.

## Why?

This is one of the most common questions candidates have as they get started with this process. **Why do things this way?** After all:

- 1 Lots of great candidates don't do well in these sorts of interviews.
- 2 You could look up the answer if it did ever come up.
- 3 You rarely have to use data structures such as binary search trees in the real world. If you did need to, you could surely learn it.
- 4 Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. You would never code on the whiteboard in the real world, obviously.

These complaints aren't without merit. In fact, I agree with all of them, at least in part.

At the same time, there is reason to do things this way for some--not all--positions. It's not important that you agree with this logic, but it is a good idea to understand why these questions are being asked. It helps offer a little insight into the interviewer's mindset.


## False negatives are acceptable.

This is sad (and frustrating for candidates), but true.

<mark>From the company's perspective, it's actually acceptable that some good candidates are rejected.</mark> The company is out to build a great set of employees. They can accept that they miss out on some good people. They'd prefer not to, of course, as it raises their recruiting costs. It is an acceptable tradeoff, though, provided they can still hire enough people.

They're far more concerned with **false positives**: people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

## Problem-solving skills are valuable.

If you're able to work through several hard problems (with some help, perhaps), you're probably pretty good at developing optimal algorithms. **You're smart.**

Smart people tend to do good things, and that's valuable at a company. It's not the only thing that matters, of course, but it is a really good thing.

## Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful.

Many interviewers would argue that basic computer science knowledge is, in fact, useful. Understanding **trees, graphs, lists, sorting**, and other knowledge does come up periodically. When it does, it's really valuable.

Could you learn it as needed? Sure. But <mark>it's very difficult to know that you should use a binary search tree if you don't know of its existence.</mark> And if you do know of its existence, then you pretty much know the basics.

Other interviewers justify the reliance on data structures and algorithms by arguing that it's a good *"proxy."* Even if the skills wouldn't be that hard to learn on their own, they say it's reasonably well-correlated with being a good developer. It means that you've either gone through a computer science program (in which case you've learned and retained a reasonably broad set of technical knowledge) or learned this stuff on your own. Either way, it's a good sign.

There's another reason why data structure and algorithm knowledge comes up: because it's hard to ask problem-solving questions that don't involve them. It turns out that the vast majority of problem-solving questions involve some of these basics. When enough candidates know these basics, it's easy to get into a pattern of asking questions with them.

## Whiteboards let you focus on what matters.

It's absolutely true that you'd struggle with writing perfect code on a whiteboard. Fortunately, **your interviewer doesn't expect that.** Virtually everyone has some bugs or minor syntactical errors.

The nice thing about a whiteboard is that, in some ways, you can focus on the big picture. You don't have a compiler, so you don't need to make your code compile. You don't need to write the entire class definition and boilerplate code. <mark>You get to focus on the interesting, "meaty" parts of the code: the function that the question is really all about.</mark>

That's not to say that you should just write pseudocode or that correctness doesn't matter. Most interviewers aren't okay with pseudocode, and fewer errors are better.

Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process. When a candidate is given a computer, their communication drops substantially.

## But it's not for everyone or every company or every situation.

The above sections are intended to help you understand the thought process of the company.

My personal thought? For the right situation, when done well, it's a reasonable judge of someone's problem-solving skills, in that people who do well tend to be fairly smart.

However, **it's often not done very well.** You have bad interviewers or people who just ask bad questions.

It's also not appropriate for all companies. Some companies should value someone's prior experience more or need skills with particular technologies. These sorts of questions don't put much weight on that.

It also won't measure someone's work ethic or ability to focus. Then again, almost no interview process can really evaluate this.

This is not a perfect process by any means, but what is? All interview processes have their downsides.

I'll leave you with this: **it is what it is, so let's do the best we can with it.**

## How questions are selected

Candidates frequently ask what the "recent" interview questions are at a specific company. Just asking this question reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of where questions come from.

<mark>At the vast majority of companies, there are no lists of what interviewers should ask. Rather, each interviewer selects their own questions.</mark>

Since it's somewhat of a "free for all" as far as questions, there's nothing that makes a question a "recent Google interview question" other than the fact that some interviewer who happens to work at Google just so happened to ask that question recently.

The questions asked this year at Google do not really differ from those asked three years ago. In fact, the questions asked at Google generally don't differ from those asked at similar companies (Amazon, Facebook, etc.).

There are some broad differences across companies. Some companies focus on **algorithms** (often with some system design worked in), and others really like **knowledge-based questions**. But within a given category of question, there is little that makes it "belong" to one company instead of another. A Google algorithm question is essentially the same as a Facebook algorithm question.

## It's All Relative

If there's no grading system, how are you evaluated? How does an interviewer know what to expect of you?

Good question. The answer actually makes a lot of sense once you understand it.

<mark>Interviewers assess you relative to other candidates on that same question by the same interviewer. It's a relative comparison.</mark>

For example, suppose you came up with some cool new brainteaser or math problem. You ask your friend Alex the question, and it takes him 30 minutes to solve it. You ask Bella and she takes 50 minutes. Chris is never able to solve it. Dexter takes 15 minutes, but you had to give him some major hints and he probably would have taken far longer without them. Ellie takes 10 minutes and comes up with an alternate approach you weren't even aware of. Fred takes 35 minutes.

You'll walk away saying, *"Wow, Ellie did really well. I'll bet she's pretty good at math."* (Of course, she could have just gotten lucky. And maybe Chris got unlucky. You might ask a few more questions just to really make sure that it wasn't good or bad luck.)

Interview questions are much the same way. Your interviewer develops a feel for your performance by comparing you to other people. It's not about the candidates she's interviewing that week. It's about all the candidates that she's ever asked this question to.

For this reason, **getting a hard question isn't a bad thing.** When it's harder for you, it's harder for everyone. It doesn't make it any less likely that you'll do well.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I didn't hear back immediately after my interview. Am I rejected?**

No, there are a number of reasons why a company's decision might be delayed. A very simple explanation is that one of your interviewers hasn't provided their feedback yet. Very, very few companies have a policy of not responding to candidates they reject.

If you haven't heard back from a company within **3-5 business days** after your interview, check in (politely) with your recruiter.

## Can I re-apply to a company after getting rejected?

Almost always, but you typically have to wait a bit (**6 months to 1 year**). Your first bad interview usually won't affect you too much when you re-interview. Lots of people get rejected from Google or Microsoft and later get offers from them.
