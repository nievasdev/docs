title: III Special Situations
---

There are many paths that lead someone to this book. Perhaps you have more experience but have never done this sort of interview. Perhaps you're a tester or a PM. Or perhaps you're actually using this book to teach yourself how to interview better. Here's a little something for all these "special situations".

# Experienced Candidates

Some people assume that the algorithm-style questions you see in this book are only for recent grads. **That's not entirely true.**

More experienced engineers might see slightly less focus on algorithm questions--but only slightly.

<mark>If a company asks algorithm questions to inexperienced candidates, they tend to ask them to experienced candidates too.</mark> Rightly or wrongly, they feel that the skills demonstrated in these questions are important for all developers.

Some interviewers might hold experienced candidates to a *somewhat lower standard*. After all, it's been years since these candidates took an algorithms class. They're out of practice.

Others though hold experienced candidates to a *higher standard*, reasoning that the more years of experience allow a candidate to have seen many more types of problems.

On average, it balances out.

The exception to this rule is **system design and architecture questions**, as well as questions about your resume. Typically, students don't study much system architecture, so experience with such challenges would only come professionally. Your performance in such interview questions would be evaluated with respect to your experience level. However, students and recent graduates are still asked these questions and should be prepared to solve them as well as they can.

Additionally, experienced candidates will be expected to give a more in-depth, impressive response to questions like, *"What was the hardest bug you've faced?"* You have more experience, and your response to these questions should show it.

## Testers and SDETs

**SDETs** (Software Design Engineers in Test) write code, but to test features instead of build features. As such, they have to be great coders and great testers. Double the prep work!

If you're applying for an SDET role, take the following approach:

- **Prepare the Core Testing Problems**: For example, how would you test a light bulb? A pen? A cash register? Microsoft Word? The Testing chapter will give you more background on these problems.

- **Practice the Coding Questions**: <mark>The number one thing that SDETs get rejected for is coding skills.</mark> Although coding standards are typically lower for an SDET than for a traditional developer, SDETs are still expected to be very strong in coding and algorithms. Make sure that you practice solving all the same coding and algorithm questions that a regular developer would get.

- **Practice Testing the Coding Questions**: A very popular format for SDET questions is *"Write code to do X"*, followed up by, *"Okay now test it"*. Even when the question doesn't specifically require this, you should ask yourself, "How would I test this?" Remember: any problem can be an SDET problem!

Strong **communication skills** can also be very important for testers, since your job requires you to work with so many different people. Do not neglect the Behavioral Questions section.

## Career Advice

Finally, a word of career advice: If, like many candidates, you are hoping to apply to an SDET position as the "easy" way into a company, be aware that <mark>many candidates find it very difficult to move from an SDET position to a dev position.</mark> Make sure to keep your coding and algorithms skills very sharp if you hope to make this move, and try to switch within one to two years. Otherwise, you might find it very difficult to be taken seriously in a dev interview.

**Never let your coding skills atrophy.**

# Product (and Program) Management

These *"PM"* roles vary wildly across companies and even within a company. At Microsoft, for instance, some PMs may be essentially customer evangelists, working in a customer-facing role that borders on marketing. Across campus though, other PMs may spend much of their day coding. The latter type of PMs would likely be tested on coding, since this is an important part of their job function.

Generally speaking, interviewers for PM positions are looking for candidates to demonstrate skills in the following areas:

- **Handling Ambiguity**: This is typically not the most critical area for an interview, but you should be aware that interviewers do look for skill here. Interviewers want to see that, when faced with an ambiguous situation, you don't get overwhelmed and stall. They want to see you tackle the problem head on: seeking new information, prioritizing the most important parts, and solving the problem in a structured way. This typically will not be tested directly (though it can be), but it may be one of many things the interviewer is looking for in a problem.

- **Customer Focus (Attitude)**: Interviewers want to see that your attitude is customer-focused. <mark>Do you assume that everyone will use the product just like you do? Or are you the type of person who puts himself in the customer's shoes and tries to understand how they want to use the product?</mark> Questions like "Design an alarm clock for the blind" are ripe for examining this aspect. When you hear a question like this, be sure to ask a lot of questions to understand who the customer is and how they are using the product. The skills covered in the Testing section are closely related to this.

- **Customer Focus (Technical Skills)**: Some teams with more complex products need to ensure that their PMs walk in with a strong understanding of the product, as it would be difficult to acquire this knowledge on the job. Deep technical knowledge of mobile phones is probably not necessary to work on the Android or Windows Phone teams (although it might still be nice to have), whereas an understanding of security might be necessary to work on Windows Security. Hopefully, you wouldn't interview with a team that required specific technical skills unless you at least claim to possess the requisite skills.

- **Multi-Level Communication**: PMs need to be able to communicate with people at all levels in the company, across many positions and ranges of technical skills. Your interviewer will want to see that you possess this flexibility in your communication. This is often examined directly, through a question such as, *"Explain TCP/IP to your grandmother."* Your communication skills may also be assessed by how you discuss your prior projects.

- **Passion for Technology**: Happy employees are productive employees, so a company wants to make sure that you'll enjoy the job and be excited about your work. A passion for technology--and, ideally, the company or team--should come across in your answers. You may be asked a question directly like, *"Why are you interested in Microsoft?"* Additionally, your interviewers will look for enthusiasm in how you discuss your prior experience and how you discuss the team's challenges. They want to see that you will be eager to face the job's challenges.

- **Teamwork / Leadership**: This may be the most important aspect of the interview, and--not surprisingly--the job itself. All interviewers will be looking for your ability to work well with other people. Most commonly, this is assessed with questions like, *"Tell me about a time when a teammate wasn't pulling his/her own weight."* <mark>Your interviewer is looking to see that you handle conflicts well, that you take initiative, that you understand people, and that people like working with you.</mark> Your work preparing for behavioral questions will be extremely important here.

All of the above areas are important skills for PMs to master and are therefore key focus areas of the interview. The weighting of each of these areas will roughly match the importance that the area holds in the actual job.

# Dev Lead and Managers

Strong **coding skills** are almost always required for dev lead positions and often for management positions as well. If you'll be coding on the job, make sure to be very strong with coding and algorithms--just like a dev would be. Google, in particular, holds managers to high standards when it comes to coding.

In addition, prepare to be examined for skills in the following areas:

- **Teamwork/Leadership**: Anyone in a management-like role needs to be able to both lead and work with people. You will be examined implicitly and explicitly in these areas. Explicit evaluation will come in the form of asking you how you handled prior situations, such as when you disagreed with a manager. The implicit evaluation comes in the form of your interviewers watching how you interact with them. If you come off as too arrogant or too passive, your interviewer may feel you aren't great as a manager.

- **Prioritization**: Managers are often faced with tricky issues, such as how to make sure a team meets a tough deadline. Your interviewers will want to see that you can **prioritize a project appropriately**, cutting the less important aspects. <mark>Prioritization means asking the right questions to understand what is critical and what you can reasonably expect to accomplish.</mark>

- **Communication**: Managers need to communicate with people both above and below them, and potentially with customers and other much less technical people. Interviewers will look to see that you can communicate at many levels and that you can do so in a way that is friendly and engaging. <mark>This is, in some ways, an evaluation of your personality.</mark>

- **"Getting Things Done"**: Perhaps the most important thing that a manager can do is to be a person who *gets things done*. Managers coordinate projects and people, and they need to get things done efficiently. They need to know how to make tradeoffs and how to execute on projects.
