title: III Special Situations
---

There are many parths that lead someone to this book. Perhaps you have more experience but have never done this sort of interview. Perhaps you're a tester or a PM. Or perhaps you're actually using this book to teach yourself how to interview better. Here's a fittle something for all these "special situations".

# Experienced Candidates

Some people assume that the algorithm-style questions you see in this book are only for recent grads. That's not enterly true.

More experenced engineers might see slightly lees focus on algorithm questions--but only slightly

If a company asks algorithm questions to inexperenced candidates, they tend to ask them to experenced candidates too. Rightly or wrongly, they feel that the skills demonstrated in these questions are important for all developers.

Some interviewers might hold experience candidates to a somewhat lower standar. After all, it's been years since these candidates took an algorithms class. They're out of practice.

Others though hold experienced candidates to a higher standar, reasoning that the more years of experience allow a candidate to have seen many more types of problems.

On average, it balances out.

The exception to this rule is system design and architecture questions, as well as questions about your resume. Typically, students don't sutdy much system architecture, so experience with such challenges would only come professionally. Your performance in such interview questions would be evaluated with respect to your experience level. However, students and recent graduates are still asked these questions and should be preparated to solve them as welt as they can.

Additionally, experienced candidates will be expected to give a more in-depth, impressive response to questions like, "What was the hardest bug you've faced?" You have more experience, and your response to these questions should show it.

- Thesters and SDETs

SDETs (software design engineers in test) write code, but to test features instead of build features. As such, they have to be great coders and great testers Double the prep work!

If you're applying for an SDET role, take the following approach:

- Prepare the Core Testing Problems: For example, how would you test a light bulb? A pen? A chash register? Microsoft Word? The Testing chapter will give you more background on these probelms.

- Practice the Coding questions: The number one thing that SDETs get rejected for is coding skills. Although coding standars are typically lower for an SDET than for a traditional developer, SDETs are still expected to be very strong in coding and algorithms. Make sure that you practice solving all the same coding and the algorithm questions that a regular developer would get.

- Practice Testing the Coding Questins: A very popular format for SDET questions is "Write code to do X", followed up by, "Okay now test it", Even when the question doesn't specifically require this, you should aske yourself, "Hew would I test this" Remember; any problem can be an SDET problem!

Strong communication skills can also be very important for testers, since your job requires you to work with so many different people. Do not neglec the Behavioral Questions section.

## Career Advice

Finally, a word of career advice; If, like many candidates, you are hoping to apply to an SDET position as the "easy" way into a company, be aware that many candidates find it very difficult to move from an SDET position to a dev position. Make sure to keep your coding and algorithms skills very sharp if you hope to make this move, and try to switch within one to two years. Otherwise, you might find it very difficult to be taken seriously in adev interiew.

Never let your coding skills atrophy.

# Product (and Program) Management

These "PM" roles vary wildly across companies and even within a company. At Microsoft, for instance, some PMs may be essentially customer evangelists, working in a customer-facing role that borders on marketing. Across campus though, other PMs may spend much of their day coding. The latter type of PMs would likely be tested on coding, since tihs is an important part of their job function.
Generally speaking, inteviewers for PM position are looking for candidates to demonstrate skills in the following areas:

- Handling Ambiguity: This is typically not the most critical area for an inteview, but you should be aware that interviewers do look for skill here. Interviewer want to see that, when face with an ambiguous situation, you don't get overwhelmed and stall. Thoy want to see you tackle the problem head on: seeking new information, prioritizin the most important parts, and solving the problem in a structured way. This typically will not be tested directly (though it can be), but it may be one of many things the interviewer is looking for in a problem.

- Customer Focus (Attitude): Interviewers want to see that your attitude is customer-focused. Do you assume that everyone will use the product just like you do? Or are you the type of person who puts himself in the customer's shoes and tries to understand how they want to use the product? Questions like "Design an alarm clock for the blind" are ripe for examining this aspect. When you hear a question like this, be sure to ask a lot of questions to understand who the customer is and how they are using the product. The skills covered in the Testing section are closely related to this.

- CustomerFocus (Technical Skills). Some teams with more complex product need to ensure that their PMs walk in with a strong understanding of the product, as it would be difficult to acquire this knowledge on the job. Deep technical knowledge of mobile phones is probably not necessary to work on the Android or Windows Phone teams (although it might still be nice to have), whereas an understandig of security might be necessary to work on Windows Security. Hopefully, you wouldn't inteview with a team that required specific technical skills unless you at least claim to possess the requisite skills.

- Multi-Level Communication: PMs need to be able to communicate with peple at all levels in the company, across many positions and ranges of technical skills. Your interviewer will want to see that you possess this flexibility in your communiication. This is ofthen examined directly, through a question such as, "Explain TCP/IP to your grandmother." Your communication skills may also be assessed by how you discuss your prior projects.

- Passion for Technology: Happy employes are productive employees, so a company wants to make sure that you'll enjoy the job and be excited about your work. A passion for technology--and, ideally,, the company or team--should come across in your ansowers. You may be asked a question directly like, "Why are you interested in Microsoft" Additionally, your iterviewers will look for enthusiasm in how you discuss your prior experience and how you discuss the team's challenges. They want to see that you will be eager to face tho job's challenges.

- Teamwork f Leadership: This may be the most important aspect of the interview, and--not surprisingly--te job itself. AM interviewers will be looking for your ability to work well with other people. Most commonly, this is assessed with questions like, "Tell me about a time when a teammate wasn't pulling his/her own weight." Your interviewer is looking to see that you handle conflicts well, that you take initiative, that you understand people, and that people like working with you. Your work preparing for behavioral questions will be extremely important here.

All of the above areas are important skills for PMs to master and ar etherefore key focus areas of the interview. The weighting of each of these areas will roughly match the importance that the area holds in the actual job.
