title: Designing Data Intensive Applications
---

Technology is a powerful force in our society. Data, software, and communication can be used for bad: to **entrench** (*atrincherar*) **unfair** (*injusta*) power structures, to **undermine** (*socavar*) human rights, and to protect **vested** (*establecido*) interests. But they can also be used for good: to make **underrepresented** (*subrepresentados*) people's voices heard, to create opportunities for everyone, and to **avert** (*evitar*) disasters. <mark>This book is dedicated to everyone working toward the good.</mark>

> *Computing is pop culture, [...] Pop culture holds a* ***disdain*** *(desdén) for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future --it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from].*
