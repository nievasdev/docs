title: Designing Data Intensive Applications
---

Technology is a powerful force in our society. Data, software, and communication can be used for bad: to entrench `atrincherar` unfair `injusta` power structures, to undermine `socavar` human rights, and to protect vested `establecido` interests. But they can also be use for good: to make underreprsented `subrepresentados` people's voices heard, to create opportunities for everyone, and to avert `evitar` disasters. This book is dedicated to everyone working toward `hacia` the good

Computing is pop culture, [...] Pop culture holds a disdain `desdén` for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating. It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future --it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from].

--Alan Kay, in interview with Dr Dobb's Journal (2012)
